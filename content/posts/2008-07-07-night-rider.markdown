I did some night riding today! put on my clear face shield, and was rolling out of the garage at 8:02 pm.

first I rode up Ironwood to McKellips, then decided to do some highway driving, to go get a smoothie.

After the break, I continued west to greenfield. Just as I was exiting onto Greenfield, my low fuel light flashed; it's too bright at night. I headed back and filled up. I finally have my first mileage measurement: I rode 167 miles on 2.971 gallons. At today's gas prices, that's $12.06. [aside: I remember filling up my CAR in high school for 12 bucks] Average mpg of 56.21! pretty good considering at least 3/4 of that tank was spent on surface streets, and a good portion of it in neighborhoods even. After gassing up I headed in. 36.2 miles were covered on tonight's joy ride, and the bike has 211 miles on it now.

I am sorely tempted to ride the bike to work tomorrow!
