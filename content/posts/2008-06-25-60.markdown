got back on highway 88 and was relaxed this time. got up to 60mph. rode as far as Lost Dutchman state park, took some pictures, and then rode back and rode around in AJ a bit. 23 miles today! the odometer has 83 miles on it now.

too bad the camera decided to focus on the parking lot instead of on me
