As I've mentioned previously, I've switch Linux distributions, from gentoo to ubuntu. I was having too many hassles with gentoo. anyway, I was searching the gentoo forums to try to solve a problem on one of the left-over gentoo machines at work, and stumbled across [this thread](http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-475474-postdays-0-postorder-asc-start-0.html) (don't bother reading past the first page). sounds like others are leaving too.
