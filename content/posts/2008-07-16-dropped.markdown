rode in to work again. went after rush hour, so traffic was good. 28.0 miles, 295 miles total

The street cleaners were out and cleaning the parking lot at work today; I had to drive through the wet parking lot. the black parts of the bike were full of spots

On the way home I decided to go ahead and get gas. I pulled into the gas station, and held too much speed; when I turned left to pull in front of a pump, I had to turn the front wheel too far and when I stopped it fell right over on its side. I was trying to hold it up but it was too far over, so onto the pavement it went. I was still standing. the engine was still running even. so I hit the kill switch and tried to lift it but couldn't really, I didn't take the time to get situated to use my legs to do the work. Three other guys who were individually getting gas came over and helped me lift it, that was nice. so now it has a small scuff. shifter scraped the side of the engine and might be bent slightly, but I can't tell any difference while riding it.

bike is up to 325 miles total, the trip home with gas stop was 29.5 miles, and this tank of gas got around 52.242 mpg

Then later in the evening I rode to downtown Phoenix and back. the trip out was 36.9 miles, and the trip back was 37.0 miles. the bike is up to 399 miles now. This was the first time I got to ride down 202; I was extra careful on the curves. also I hit a cloud of bugs somewhere in Mesa, made it hard to see out the visor after that.
