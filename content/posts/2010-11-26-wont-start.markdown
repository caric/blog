After leaving the Phoenix International Auto Show, the RX-8 wouldn't start!

We went and had lunch, then bought jumper cables. When we went to hook up the jumper cables, we realized the negative battery cable was loose! I didn't do a good job re-tightening it after trying to fix the headlight.

I returned the jumper cables. I'd like to buy a trickle charger someday.
