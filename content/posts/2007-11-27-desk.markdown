I finally did something I've been meaning to do for years.... my computer desk has a shelf on it to put the monitor on. which means a person sitting at the desk is looking up at the monitor, rather than slightly down. which meant I couldn't sit at the desk for more than 10 minutes. Tonight I spent an hour and half, moving the monitor, re-routing a dozen cables, and taking the shelf off. the desk is now so much better it's unbelieveable. not perfect, but better. a little chair adjustment helped even more. I still think I have issues with this chair though; the keyboard feels too far away from me still. I might try taking the keyboard tray off the bottom of the desk (I just have a power strip there, which I think can be relocated)
