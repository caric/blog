The two BMW motorcycle dealers in town had demo days. Both days I got to ride a BMW f800st. The second time I wanted to try out a R1200R, but it was already taken. That's OK though, because I loved the f800st! I'm going to have to get one as soon as possible. This bike is similar in size and style to my ninja, but is better in every way! much more powerful, more comfortable, more stable on the highway, easier to turn, better brakes (with ABS), plus it has fancy features like heated grips, ambient temperature guage, a trip computer, and even a MPG guage (not to mention a fuel guage!)

I hope to find a used 2008; in 2009 they dropped the blue color and replaced it with a silver color, which is nice, but not as good as the blue color.
