bought an extra set of wheels with factory bridgestone potenza RE040s. can't
decide if I just got some tires for cheap for the street, want to put race
tires on the extra wheels, or if I should re-sell them and just get some nice
tires to use for both street and autocross. 



I ended up selling the wheels and tires individually on ebay for a tidy profit,
and using the proceeds to buy some Dunlop Direzza Sport Z1 tires. These tires
rock, they are by far the best tires I have ever had on any car I have ever
owned. I bought them from Carrol Shelby, who is a sponsor of my local SCCA
club.
