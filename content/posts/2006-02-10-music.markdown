I've had an ipod for a while now and knew about the 'my highest rated' smart playlist, but it was just a few days ago that I actually looked at it. sometimes while listening to the ipod at work, if a good song came up I'd rate it somewhere between 1 and 5 stars. I'm pretty conservative with the 5-star rating; to get five stars, you have to be a song that I expect I'll never get tired of.

when I took a look at the list for the first time the other day, I was surprised to see it had 78 songs on it! For some reason I was expecting it to be limited to 10 or 25 songs. anyway, that evening on the drive home I put the ipod on shuffle on the highest rated playlist... it's incredibly sublime to have a couple hours of your absolute most favorite songs queued up back to back!

next time I plug my ipod into my tired old ibook I'm going to check out some stats on the list. I wonder what my favorite band is? :)
