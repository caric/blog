I put the liners in, and it made a huge difference. I still need to get new gloves, my hands pretty much started going numb, and I have a bit of air coming in around my neck, but it's so much better than before.

Some statistics: The bike has 3115 miles now. I've gotten an average of 53.3 mpg (it's so low because my typical highway cruising speed is an indicated 80-85 mph). I've had the bike for 170 days, or 24 weeks, or nearly six months. in that time, it's cost me just under 14 cents per mile (or 6.5 cents per mile for just gas). My RX-8 costs over 19 cents per mile, most of which is gas: the RX-8 costs 14 cents per mile for gas costs alone.
