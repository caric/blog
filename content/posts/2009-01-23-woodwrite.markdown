I put Waterman cartridges in this pen. Once the current cartridge is empty, I'll be cleaning the pen thoroughly and packing it away, probably never to write with it again. (I'm now spoiled by my Pilot Vanishing Point.)

The wood is bocote from Central America.

You can mostly read the labelling in the large pictures. The nib reads "IRRIDIUM POINT GERMANY" on the front, and "6" on the back. I suspect it is actually a steel nib made in China; the Chinese didn't bother to change the words after buying the works. The other reason I suspect the nib to be of chinese origin is because the nib is very scratchy when writing. My humble Parker Vector is a bit smoother writing than this pen.

The finish on the back end of the barrel is rubbing off.

Not a very good seal. The pen must be written with nearly every day or the nib will dry out.

The wood looks very nice though!
