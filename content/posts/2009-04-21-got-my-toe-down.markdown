I had a service appointment for the ninja at 9 so I only had time to ride up to the first overlook on highway 88. Went much faster this time. On the way back down, I was taking one of the "15 mph" right-handers, and scraped my right foot! This indicates to me that I'm getting the bike leaned over.

I dropped it off at the dealer with 6461 miles on the odometer. They performed a "minor service": oil and filter change, lube the chain, inspection, top off all fluids.
