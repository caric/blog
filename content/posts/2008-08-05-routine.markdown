Rode to work today, then on to pool.

I'm going to stop adding "routine" rides on here, or it's going to get really boring.

tonight, it started raining when I was at pool league. it rained for several hours! finally around midnight it seemed to be slowing down, so I finally headed home. once I got out of tempe and more into mesa, the rain was gone, and as I went further east the highway was dry! that was nice.

the only real problem I had was that my helmet and gloves were out on the bike, so my gloves were soaked. the blue dye got on my hands, and so my hands are stained purple.

the fun part was the wind. it kept pushing me to the right. so I leaned forward on the bike and had to lean the bike over to the left quite a bit to get it to stop going to the right. it was gusty wind too, so it was pretty challenging. a lot of fun though.
