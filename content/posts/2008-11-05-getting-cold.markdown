I've been thinking I need to get more practice on curvy roads. Also, I need to do some longer rides, since my typical rides are all between 30 and 40 miles long.

Today when I left for work, I decided to head down highway 88 toward Canyon Lake first, to work on both those goals.

It seemed colder out today.

I had fun riding up through the curves, got to a nice pull-out.

Then turned around and headed back. I ended up adding 20 miles to my morning commute, so this morning was a 50 mile ride instead of only 30.

When I was almost to work, I exited from 202 onto Scottsdale road as normal. After I turned onto scottsdale road, I started accelerating as normal. When it was time to shift, I turned on the turn signal instead of pulling in the clutch! I'm pretty sure I was experiencing an early symptom of hypothermia! By this point, I had been riding for about an hour. typical ride to work is 35 minutes. it was 65 degrees out and cloudy. I suspect at the beginning of the ride it was probably closer to 60 degrees. I was still wearing summer riding gear, i.e., a mesh jacket!

I plan to put the liners in my jacket and pants tonight, and this weekend I will get some winter riding gloves.
