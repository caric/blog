Just held the digital camera to the eyepiece and shot some pictures.

To get the moon to come out at all, I set a custom white balance, turned exposure compensation down as far as it would go (to -2). the exposure time was only 1/6 s.

this is jupiter. the 4 smaller blurry dots are the 4 'gallilean' moons (the 4 largest moons that galilleo could see with his telescope in the 16th century). callisto is the one way off by itself. the others are io, europa, and ganymede. this was a 1 second exposure. I also set it to an iso of 400. jupiter is too bright, the stripes don't show up.

next time I'll have to try using the tripod with the digital camera.
