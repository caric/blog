Last Thursday I was getting on the highway, accelerating gently up the onramp, w
hen I heard a loud "Pop!". Then the car had no power and the tach started slowly
 sliding lower and lower.



The battery light flashed once.

Then the check engine light came on and stayed on.

By this time I had coasted to the shoulder.

Turns out I had lost at least one apex seal in rotor #2.

Fortunately, I was at about 90,500 miles and the powertrain warranty had been extended by Mazda to 100,000 miles.

So I'm getting a Mazda-remanufactured engine installed at Berge Mazda.

Took a few pictures in the middle of the swap.
