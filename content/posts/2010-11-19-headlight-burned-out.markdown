The driver's side headlight stopped working. Oddly, for a brief time it worked sometimes but not others.

Without stopping to think, I ordered [new headlight bulbs](http://www.therpmstore.com/product_info.php?cPath=57&products_id=177&osCsid=irb0256c126k8ko95dulmfiht5).

Once they arrived, I removed the driver's side wheelwell and reached in to change the bulb.

After putting in the new bulb, the headlight still didn't work!

I put the old headlight back in and ordered a new ballast. The service manual calls it the "Discharge headlight control module". I think it produces the 25,000 volts needed by the High Intensity Discharge (HID) bulb.

Taking the wheelwell out is a major pain; mainly because the plastic fasteners used are easily broken. I think I broke 3 or 4 of them.
