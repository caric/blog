Rode in a bit later today, so I took 60 and 101. 28.0 miles, bike is up to 707 miles now.

I thought sure I was going to get rained on tonight! There was a huge thunderstorm over the Superstition Mountains. Lots of lightening bolts. But I made it home dry, and it started raining about 30 minutes after I got home. I stopped off at the bank. The trip home was 32.9 miles, and the bike is up to 740 miles now. I made an appointment for the first service for next Saturday.
