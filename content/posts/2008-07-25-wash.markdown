took 60 to work again, I was at the 101 interchange right at 9:00, so 101 traffic was fine, just a little bit slow. up to 768 miles, and the trip in was 28.0 miles

after work I fed the cats, then took McDowell to Alma School, then got on 202 from there. interesting driving through the fringe of the reservation. up to 802 miles now, and the trip home was 33.2 miles.

Tonight I washed the bike. it's a lot quicker than washing a car!
