Brian, Dan, and I set out much earlier (left at 8:30 instead of 10), rode to Clifton, AZ, and from there attacked the "Tail of the Beast"; US191 from Morenci to Alpine. This road used to be designated US666 and was affectionately known as "The Devil's Road".

From Alpine we jumped back on 180 and headed back for Safford. Made it back around 5pm.

280 miles total for today.
