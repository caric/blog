It wasn't bad riding in. I just took it carefully. the HOV lane was nice. traffic was slow and thick on 101 which was annoying.

The ride in was 28.0 miles, and the bike is up to 239 miles now.

Ride home was hot, but not as bad as I expected. 27.9 miles, total of 267 miles. this was a good day to ride to work; it was only around 100 degrees when I left work to go home. I could feel the heat on my legs from the highway!
