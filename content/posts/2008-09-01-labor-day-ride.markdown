Went on a [little ride](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&hl=en&geocode=&saddr=14929+W+Lisbon+Ln,+Surprise,+AZ+85379&daddr=wickenburg,+az+to:skull+valley,+az+to:prescott,+az+to:wickenburg,+az+to:14929+West+Lisbon+Lane,+surprise,+az&mra=pr&doflg=ptm&sll=33.99391,-112.20048&sspn=2.381788,3.087158&ie=UTF8&ll=34.143635,-112.420349&spn=1.188836,1.543579&z=9) with Brian and Kristy.

The trip was 327 miles for me, since I had to ride out to Brian and Kristy's house and back also. I have 1870 miles on the bike now.

During the main part of the trip, I averaged 64.4 mpg!

This is by far the longest I've ridden in one day. By the end, I needed to stop every 30 or 40 miles to rest.
