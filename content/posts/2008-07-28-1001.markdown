I got up WAY late today, so I was able to take 60, 101, 202 to work today since rush hour was over. the trip in was 28.1 miles, and the main odometer shows 967 miles now.

After work I went and fed the cats, then took thomas to 101 and then got on 202. I was getting on the highway around 6:30, but I decided not to risk getting stuck on 101. The trip home was 33 miles, and the motorcycle is now at 1001 miles! I have an appointment on saturday for the first service (oil change, valve timing, and chain adjustment)
