I set up mail.app on Mountain Lion with all my accounts, including the Apple ID I used with MobileMe. The result was nearly every operation in mail.app resulted in a minute or two of the spinning beach ball. 

After much wailing and gnashing of teeth, I noticed errors in the Console.app referring to my MobileMe's apple id, so I deleted that account completely from Mail.app and now it all works great!
