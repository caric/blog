Did you get the iPhoto app for iPhone and iPad yet? I did, and was disappointed at first.

Until I read this [iPhoto review](http://www.suntimes.com/technology/12383842-478/results-make-up-for-awkwardness-of-iphoto-for-ipad.html).

Now I love to use iPhoto to winnow my multiple shots of the same scene down to one and only one photo. I favorite the winner, then delete all of them from camera roll. iPhoto saves its own copy of any photo you favorite or edit.

After making sure the "Include Photo Location" switch is ON in the gear/settings icon, I share all favorites to iTunes and iTunes lets me save the photos to a folder in my photo archive. All over wifi.

Apparently iPhoto is also highly effective at editing photosâ€”adjusting contrast, brightness, and the like. I'll try that out someday.
