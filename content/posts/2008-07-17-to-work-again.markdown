Drove the bike to work and back again today. I've been riding it so much I've actually gotten some sore muscles. I found myself on the way home today making a conscious effort to relax more. I typically have my arms relaxed, but my shoulders and neck tend to tense up.

The trip in was 28.1 miles, and the trip home was 27.9 miles. the bike is up to a total of 455 miles now.

I hope to go get some soft luggage for the bike this weekend; I need to start hauling extra clothes to work so I can take a shower when I get there. I just have to figure out how to reserve the shower room

I have my eye on the cortech sport bags, since they work well and are not very expensive. they are available in red, whichÂ [matches my bike](http://www.ninja650.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?t=9420&highlight=cortech)
