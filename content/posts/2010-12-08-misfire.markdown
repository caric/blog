Going down the onramp onto US60, I was getting on it ... hit redline in first gear, shifted to second, continued at full throttle. Power dipped, the check engine light started flashing! I let off the throttle, and the check engine light stopped flashing. Seems to be running fine now; probably a misfire. It's time to replace the spark plugs anyway ...
