fed the cats on the way to work and went to the bank. The trip in was 32.1 miles, bike is at 1033 miles now.

trip home (including a gas stop) was 29.2 miles. bike is at 1062 miles now.

This fill-up was 3.091 gallons, $11.80, and 55.969 average mpg. I got gas early since I probably won't ride again until friday. The low fuel light came on just as I exited the highway at the gas station.
