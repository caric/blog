You get to decide how you feel.

This is a technique I learned once, for use when I am faced with a choice of (thinking unpleasant thoughts or having a bad mood or feeling down) or of feeling good. It works for me.

This came from [Mindful Loving](http://www.amazon.com/Mindful-Loving-Practices-Creating-Connections/dp/1592400264).

Whenever you have a thought or emotion that disturbs your peace:

1. identify and call out the thought: think to yourself "oh, this is one of THOSE disturbing thoughts!"
2. remind yourself that if you continue to think about the disturbing thought, you will only feel worse. ask yourself if you want to continue feeling the way you just started feeling? if you don't want to continue with this disturbing thought, then:
3. say to yourself "STOP!"
4. Replace the disturbing thought with a self-affirming aphorism, one that you believe in. Something like "I am love", "I deserve to be happy", or even something as simple as "I'm awesome", but it must be something simple that you believe in.

The more practice you get at this, the better it works. one of the keys is to have your aphorism ready, and to practice the aphorism.

The reason this works is it teaches you to intellectually reason about the workings of your own thoughts and emotions, and be able to observe them as they happen.

It's up to you how you feel!
