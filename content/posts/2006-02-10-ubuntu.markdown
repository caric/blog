it seems like I won't be a Gentoo Linux user for much longer. My server (Gentoo Linux) has suffered a lot of problems lately. I think that Gentoo now has too many packages and too few developers. pretty much any update I've done in the last 6 months on any of the 6 or so computers I maintain has caused non-trivial problems. I've now changed my server, my work machine, and my desktop machine over to ubuntu. the only gentoo boxes I have left are my firewall, my backup server, and my dad's firewall. the backup server will be ubuntu within the next couple weeks.
