Rode in to work, on the new 202. 31.3 miles. traffic was good, right up until a mile before my exit, where it turned into full-blown stop and go. I have difficulty transitioning from high-speed control to low speed control; it's kind of a shock to slow way down and then try to maneuver at low speeds. the bike is up to 580 miles now.

I'm feeling really good on the bike in general; I think I've gotten some toning in whatever new muscles I'm using to ride the bike, plus I'm more and more relaxed on it. Now if it just weren't so hot out, it would be great!

After work, I rode to my pool league which tonight was at Tom Ryan's. highlights of the evening included getting beer spilled on me and the resulting beer puddle making it to where I had set my helmet, so I washed the liners tonight and they are sitting under a fan, hopefully they will be dry in the morning. Bike is up to a total of 615 miles now. The trip from the office to the bar and then home was 35.2 miles.
