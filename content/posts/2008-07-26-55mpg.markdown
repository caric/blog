Rode to the pool store, to feed the cats, then on to downtown phoenix. got the low fuel light on the way back, so I got gas in AJ on the way home. I rode home a little slower with the low fuel light in my eye, even though I knew I had enough gas to get there.

48.7 miles there, 38.1 miles home. Bike is up to 888 miles now. This fill up was 3.795 gallons, $14.72, 209 miles, for an average mpg of 55.072
