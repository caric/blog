Claire and Joy coined a new word: urbanvore, a person (often homeless) who subsists on whatever the city streets provide. It's a good day when a produce truck full of apples loses a crate!

We consider [freeganism](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeganism) to be distinct from urbanvores. A freegan who lives in the city would also be considered an urbanvore, but an urbanvore does not necessarily have to be a freegan.
