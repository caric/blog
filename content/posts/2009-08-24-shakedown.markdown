Got the bike out again, put gas in it, and took a little shakedown ride. Got to watch lightning all over the valley, in front of me all the way from the south to the north as I headed west from home. Fortunately all the rain was well to the west of me. Went and got cash, fish tacos, and a vanilla coke. I could tell I hadn't ridden in a while! Out of shape. On the way home I did hit full throttle and redline down the onramp, that was fun.

Only rode about 27 miles tonight, about half on local streets with stop lights, half highway. 8052 miles total now.
