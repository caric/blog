Got going about 10am, got gas, rode to Springerville via highway 180 in New Mexico.

Some high elevation on the way, up to 7000 feet, so we saw lots of pine trees.

Just before Springerville we hit incredibly strong winds. Parked at Los Dos Molinos in Springerville, I was worried the bike would fall over. It was even worse trying to get gas after lunch.

From Springerville, we rode on to Quemado, NM, then cut over on NM32 to Apache Creek, through Reserve, NM, and then rejoined 180 and went back to Safford the way we had come from there.

Brian and and I rode 394 miles in 8 hours 22 minutes; approximately 7 hours of actual saddle time.
