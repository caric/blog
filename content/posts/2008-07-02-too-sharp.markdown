I was out on the bike by 5:45 am.

I rode up to the overlook over canyon lake this morning.

on the way up, I was taking those turns at about 25--30 and that of course was utterly easy, even at my 2 degree lean angles.

On the way back down I increased a bit to 30--35mph, and one time I even leaned it over too far. I was taking a right hand turn and I think I was making the turn about half the radius it should have been, so that was fun. I remembered not to snap off the throttle, I was able to get it to stand back up a bit. I'm also practicing relaxing my arms

once I got back to the straight part of the road, I hit 85 mph briefly.

148 miles on the bike, 27.4 miles today.
