this entry is in logjam. After I followed the link from the livejournal page for gtk+ clients and saw the client was called logjam, I checked to see if gentoo had an ebuild for it with 'emerge -s logjam'. for some reason there were two, so I picked the newer one and installed it with 'emerge net-misc/logjam'. I'm amazed every day at [gentoo linux](http://www.gentoo.org)
