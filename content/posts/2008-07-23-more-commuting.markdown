The helmet was dried out this morning.

Rode in to work, and stopped off at Berge Mazda to buy some RX-8 parts. it was 17.3 miles to Berge Mazda. From there I went to work with a brief stop to feed some cats. 14.2 miles. the bike is up to 646 miles now.

The ride home was 32.9 miles (took 202). traffic was great. I got gas on the way home, mileage was around 51mpg. I've been driving at an indicated 83 mph most of the time, which is actually around 75mph. Bike is at 679 miles now.
