Complications work much better with WatchOS 2 (I'm on 2.2). No more rebooting the watch to get the sunset time.


# But


Apps are still slow.

WatchOS 2 brought color to the complications on the Utility face. Most complications look nice with color, but the Sunrise, Stopwatch, and Timer are a [hideous orange](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2015/09/23/thompson-utility-color), which forces me to set the second hand to match. So instead of using my favorite yellow second hand:

I have to use an orange one, when I have the Stopwatch or Timer complication on the face:

# New Routines


I'm more comfortable with some of the watch faces now, and I have set up three Utility faces, a Chronograph face, a Simple face, and a Modular face to be switched to at will. The various faces leverage the complications for Stocks, World Clock, Carrot Weather, Fantastical, Activity, Moon Phase, and even mean-old-orange Stopwatch, Timer, and Sunset.


# Faces


My normal, "during the day" setup is to use one of my Utility faces. The first has Stocks along the bottom, the second, [Carrot Weather](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/carrot-weather-talking-forecast/id961390574?mt=8), and the third features [Fantastical](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fantastical-2-for-iphone-calendar/id718043190?mt=8) in the bottom slot.

In the top two complication slots, I'll switch between any of the Carrot, Fantastical, Timer, Stopwatch, Sunrise/sunset, Activity, Moon Phase, or World Clock, depending on what I need that day.


## Utility


My typical Utility Stock setup (with New York City showing on World Clock so I know when the market has closed at 4:30):

## Simple


In the evening, I've taken to using the Simple watch face more than I expected. Its refreshingly monochrome complications balance its infuriating over-abundance of tick marks:

## Chronograph


Setting the Chronograph face to a white background allows the second hand to remain visible while running the chronograph, plus other complications are monochrome. Anytime I expect to use the Stopwatch a lot (like grilling or timing things at work), I can use the chronograph face again. Plus it matches the gauges in my car!

## Modular


Because of using [Sleep++](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sleep++/id1038440371?mt=8) to track my sleep, I've set up a modular face, in red, to preserve night vision. The Battery complication makes its only appearance here!

I still use the yelow modular face for travelling, or if i need to pack maximum data onto the screen.

# Apps


The Complications are, by far, the biggest use of my watch. I do sometimes use apps, but only sparingly, since they are so slow as to usually not be worth the bother.

I use Evernote as a reference, while playing cards or anytime I'm short on hands but want to refer to data:

[![](/wp-uploads/astrophoenix/2016/04/img_4942.jpg)](/wp-uploads/astrophoenix/2016/04/img_4942.jpg) 

Nearly essential are [TimeOfYourLife](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/timeofyourlife-pro-multiple/id1057736367?mt=8) for multiple stopwatches and [Due](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/due-reminders-countdown-timers/id390017969?mt=8) for multiple countdown timers. Scandalous, Apple Watch only shipping with one of each!

Sometimes I use [Fantastical](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fantastical-2-for-iphone-calendar/id718043190?mt=8) to show my shared grocery list from the Reminders app to lessen my fear of dropping my phone while pushing the cart in the grocery store.

And yes I can start my car from my watch!

# Opinion


the Apple Watch is worth it and makes a great reference and tool due to the complications. Apps are good too if you have the patience.
