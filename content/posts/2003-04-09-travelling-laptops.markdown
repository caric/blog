we're flying home in the morning for my wife's baby shower number 1 (or baby shower east if you prefer).  
  
We decided not to bring our laptops since it's only a few days and taking it on the plane is a big hassle.  
  
I spent several days psyching myself up to this idea. Now I'm excited about reading on the plane rather than playing with my laptop.  
  
But today Chelby realized she needs to bring her laptop so she can show pictures to everyone at the shower! (no computer at the shower location so even a cd won't do)  
  
hmmm, do I want to go through the stress of taking my laptop on the plane just to have it when I get there....!!!!
