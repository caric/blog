Purchased via [Citroenpers](http://www.citroenpers.nl/).

This pen had a rough ride from the Netherlands to me. It took nearly a  month! The plastic case the pen was shipped in was cracked in several  places, but the pen itself was unscarred.

There was some condensation inside the barrel, so I took the nib off  and it dried out over night. Then I was finally able to ink up and write  with it. Nice writing experience. My complaint is the pen is too light,  I prefer something more substantial. This Pelikan is lighter even than a  Lamy Safari, and very small.
