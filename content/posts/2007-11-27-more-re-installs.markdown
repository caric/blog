now I'm thinking about re-building my server too, after the successes with my workstation and laptop. for this one, I would get a new, big hard drive, and do the install on it, then copy all the files over. first step will be to shop for hard drives; they are cheap now, but I hope they still make the kind I need for my server, which is a turn of the century model.
