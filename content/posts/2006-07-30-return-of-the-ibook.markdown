my poor ibook g3, after 5 hours of surgery last night and this morning, is a changed computer.  the ibook had long suffered from a bad gpu connection on the logic board, resulting in a mostly unreadable display.  now, thanks to some [web insight](http://www.powerbook-fr.com/ibook/bricolage/repair_g3_video_en_article797.html), a nice slab of copper (thank you, Chelby), and a cabinet door bumper, the ibook display is perfect again.  I took advantage of the disassembly requirement to replace the hard drive, with a slightly fast and larger capacity drive. so now I have to reinstall everything.
