Jeremy sent me a Lamy 2000 fountain pen for Christmas! I've been wanting one of these for a few months.

Currently, this has displaced my Vanishing Point as favorite pen. The vanishing point is smoother, but on good paper, it's too smooth, and feels like writing on ice. The Lamy 2000, on the other hand, feels perfect on good paper. Still smooth, it also has some pleasant feedback. After writing with the Lamy, the Vanishing Point feels wild and out of control.

On ordinary paper, the Vanishing Point's extra smoothness is a plus ... the Lamy still feels good on mediocre paper, just a bit heavier than on good paper.
