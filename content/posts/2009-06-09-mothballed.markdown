Today marked the last fill-up on gas for the summer. I rode this tank out, and the ninja has been sitting in my garage with the low-fuel light flashing ever since. I've moved it into the driveway and back into the garage about twice just to keep the battery going. maybe I should look into a trickle charger for next summer.
