so having used zsh for a while, I'm definitely glad I changed. my only irritant is that when I hit 'escape' then the '/' key to search in my history, I have to pause for 0.4 seconds between the two so zsh uses the search history meaning for that key combo rather than the generic completion meaning. There is a shell variable that allows you to adjust the interval: KEYTIMEOUT. have to try that with 0.2 seconds maybe
