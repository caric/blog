rode to downtown phoenix, then to work. low fuel light came on, on the way to Phoenix, got gas around the corner from work. I had to drive around a while trying to find a gas station, ended up at a Valero. It was 37.5 miles to Phoenix, then it was 16.3 miles to the gas station and to the office. the bike is up to 509 miles now. this tank of gas was 54.374 mpg, and I rode 184 miles on it

on the ride home, I took the new 202, which is now open all the way from 101 to 60. It was much nicer than that few miles on 101 which is really slow. no car pool lane though. This way was 31.6 miles instead of the usual 28. I think it was worth the extra three miles to avoid the stop and go traffic. bike is up to 540 miles now.

Just made my first grocery run on the bike; I stuffed a pint of strawberries, a huge bottle of conditioner, a block of cheese, a full-size box of kleenex and two rolls of paper towels into the backpack. somehow I managed to ride 7.9 miles, just going to Wal-Mart and back. total of 548 miles now.

This was quite a ride; there was a clump of rain off to the northwest on my way there, and the setting sun was shining through it. on the way home, there appeared to be a thunderstorm building up, I was a bit nervous about getting rained on while packing up the groceries. made it home completely dry, though, and the radar is confirming that the rain is staying just to the northwest of me.
